# Mathematically Beautiful Language

This is a preview into the possibility of using the _C_ programming language and tools such as _flex_ and _bison_ to create _mbl_ (a Mathematically Beautiful Language).

Now, there are so many programming languages and there is an academic way that mathematicians express themselves in writing by using symbols that are not readily available on the QWERTY keyboard.

## Usage

To compile this interpreter perform the following,
```bash
make
```

You can find details in the _Makefile_
