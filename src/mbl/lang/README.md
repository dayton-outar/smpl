# Mathematically Beautiful Language

This is a preview into the possibility of using the _C_ programming language and tools such as _flex_ and _bison_ to create _mbl_ (a Mathematically Beautiful Language).

Now, there are so many programming languages and there is an academic way that mathematicians express themselves in writing formulas (which is a function) by using symbols that are not readily available on the QWERTY keyboard. The idea here is to construct a language that makes use of unicode and/or a tool such as [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to write the mathematical expressions but also to evaluate those expressions. Imagine a programming language that can evaluate πr² (where π is built-in value and r is a variable). Or what about,
```
4
Σ n
n=1
```

This is proof of concept that is an excuse for using _flex_ and _bison_.
## Usage

To compile this interpreter perform the following,
```bash
make
```

You can find details in the _Makefile_
